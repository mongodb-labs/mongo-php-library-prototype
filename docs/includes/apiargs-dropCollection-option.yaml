arg_name: option
name: encryptedFields
type: array|object
description: |
  A document describing encrypted fields for queryable encryption. If omitted,
  the ``encryptedFieldsMap`` option within the ``autoEncryption`` driver option
  will be consulted. If ``encryptedFieldsMap`` was defined but does not specify
  this collection, the library will make a final attempt to consult the
  server-side value for ``encryptedFields``. See
  `Field Encryption and Queryability <https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/core/queryable-encryption/fundamentals/encrypt-and-query/>`_
  in the MongoDB manual for more information.

  .. note::

     This option is not passed to the :manual:`drop </reference/command/drop>`
     command. The library uses it to determine related metadata collections that
     should be dropped in addition to an encrypted collection.
