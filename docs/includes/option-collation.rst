:manual:`Collation </reference/collation>` allows users to specify
language-specific rules for string comparison, such as rules for lettercase
and accent marks. When specifying collation, the ``locale`` field is mandatory;
all other collation fields are optional. For descriptions of the fields,
see :manual:`Collation Document </reference/collation/#collation-document>`.
