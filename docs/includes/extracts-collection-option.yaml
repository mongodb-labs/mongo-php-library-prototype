  The :doc:`codec </tutorial/codecs>` to use for encoding or decoding documents.
  This option is mutually exclusive with the ``typeMap`` option.

  Defaults to the collection's codec. Inheritance for a default ``codec`` option
  takes precedence over that of the ``typeMap`` option.

  If the collation is unspecified but the collection has a default collation,
  the operation uses the collation specified for the collection. If no
  collation is specified for the collection or for the operation, MongoDB uses
  the simple binary comparison used in prior versions for string comparisons.
